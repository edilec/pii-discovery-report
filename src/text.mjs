/**
 * The boundary every untrusted string crosses on its way to output, plus the
 * two things that decide whether the output can be trusted at all: how a parse
 * failure is described, and what this tool is allowed to say about its own
 * work.
 *
 * Three defences live here, and each exists because its absence produced a real
 * defect in this catalog:
 *
 * 1. `sanitize` is the ONE boundary. Field paths, dataset names, recogniser
 *    ids, messages, evidence and masked examples all pass through it -- not
 *    only an `evidence` field. A shipped tool sanitised its evidence carefully
 *    and let an identifier carrying a newline forge whole lines in the report.
 * 2. `parseFailureDetail` recognises the quoting shape BEFORE looking for a
 *    position. A document that literally reads `at position 1` makes V8 quote
 *    it back, and a position-first helper slices the document out of its own
 *    error message. For a tool whose input is a dataset of personal data, that
 *    is the leak that matters most.
 * 3. `msg` splits this tool's own literals from interpolated values. The
 *    literals are checked for claims this tool is not entitled to make; the
 *    values, which come from an untrusted document, are sanitised. The scan
 *    looks at what this tool WROTE, never at what it read -- a dataset field
 *    literally named `proven_customer` is data and must not stop the run.
